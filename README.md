# CALCULATOR
![Calculator Icon](/CalculatorSmall.png)

Calculator will be the default Calculator app for AROS

Like most of the other default applications it is written in C++

At the moment it is a very basic calculator,

We will continue to add more to it.

# Install
Calculator will be available pre-installed on AROS, but until then you can install it here!

Firstly, get the code by opening a terminal and typing 
```
git clone https://github.com/AR4789-OS/Calculator.git -b build-latest
```

I have included an `install.sh` script

Navigate to the code with:

```
cd Calculator
```

run it as root by entering the following command:

```
sudo bash install.sh
```
